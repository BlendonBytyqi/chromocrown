    <div class="about-content">
      <p>
        CHROMOCROWN was founded in <strong>2025</strong> in <strong>Prishtina</strong>, the capital city of
        <strong>Kosovo</strong>, with a clear vision: to bring precision, elegance, and trust into the world
        of luxury timepieces.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea behind CHROMOCROWN was born from a deep appreciation for craftsmanship and the belief
        that a watch is more than just a tool for telling time. It is a symbol of personality, success,
        and legacy. With this philosophy in mind, the brand was created to offer watches that combine
        innovation, tradition, and timeless design.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the beginning, CHROMOCROWN focused on offering carefully selected watches from globally
        respected brands such as <strong>Casio</strong>, <strong>Rolex</strong>, and
        <strong>Patek Philippe</strong>. Each brand represents a unique identity — Casio for reliability
        and modern technology, Rolex for prestige and performance, and Patek Philippe for exceptional
        craftsmanship and exclusivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Established in 2025, CHROMOCROWN continues to grow as a modern watch retailer, blending traditional
        horology with a contemporary digital experience while maintaining the highest standards of quality
        and customer trust.
